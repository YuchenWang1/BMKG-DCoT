## data
This file provides a pipeline for converting raw Neo4j-exported graph data into a structured format that is easier to query and analyze. The workflow includes raw data (`raw.json`), a processing script (`processing.py`), and multiple JSON files for queries and results.

### Folder Contents
- **raw.json**  
  The original graph data exported from Neo4j.  

- **processing.py**  
  A Python script that converts `raw.json` into a structured and searchable graph format, saved as `graph.json`.  

- **graph.json**  
  The processed graph data, generated by running `processing.py`. This format organizes nodes by type and makes queries more efficient.  

- **data.json**  
  A query file containing standard search queries used against the graph.  

- **data_missing.json**  
  A query file that focuses on incomplete or fuzzy queries. Useful for testing robustness against missing or ambiguous information.  

- **cache-all-mpnet-base-v2.pkl**  
  A cached model file (used for embeddings or semantic search).  

### Usage
1. Place your `raw.json` file inside the folder.  
2. Run the conversion script:  
   ```bash
   python processing.py
   ```  
3. The output `graph.json` will be generated.  
4. Use `data.json` and `data_missing.json` to perform queries on the graph.
